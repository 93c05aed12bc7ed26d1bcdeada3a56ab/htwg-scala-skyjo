## Goal

Every player gets 12 numeric cards which they want to optimize during the game. The player with the smallest sum at the end wins this round.

## Rules

The 150 cards show values ranging from -2 to +12 (10x each value). Every player gets a hidden set of 12 cards which they order in a 4x3 grid. The player then can choose 2 of those cards which they want to reveal before the round starts.
